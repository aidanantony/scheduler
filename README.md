# Interview Scheduler

The interview scheduler is a web application that will have you setting up your next mentor meeting with ease! This project is React based.

## Project Overview

The available interviews are Monday to Friday. You can see how many spots are remaining under each day, or by clicking the day itself and checking that days schedule out. On an open time slot, a user can create an appointment. In case they need to change something on their booked appointment, the user can edit their appointment or even cancel it if no longer needed.
